o combine the personal data and exam data into a single sheet using VBA, you can use a VBA macro to merge the two worksheets. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Press Alt + F11 to open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor in Excel.

In the VBA editor, click on Insert in the menu and then select Module. This will insert a new module for your VBA code.

In the module, paste the following VBA code:
Sub CombineData()
    Dim wsPersonal As Worksheet
    Dim wsExam As Worksheet
    Dim wsCombined As Worksheet
    
    ' Set references to the worksheets
    Set wsPersonal = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("PersonalData") ' Replace "PersonalData" with the actual name of your personal data sheet
    Set wsExam = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("ExamData") ' Replace "ExamData" with the actual name of your exam data sheet
    
    ' Add a new worksheet for combined data
    Set wsCombined = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add
    wsCombined.Name = "CombinedData" ' You can change the name if you prefer
    
    ' Copy personal data to combined sheet
    wsPersonal.UsedRange.Copy Destination:=wsCombined.Cells(1, 1)
    
    ' Determine the last row of the combined sheet
    lastRow = wsCombined.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Copy exam data to combined sheet starting from the row after the last personal data row
    wsExam.UsedRange.Copy Destination:=wsCombined.Cells(lastRow + 1, 1)
    
    ' Clean up
    Set wsPersonal = Nothing
    Set wsExam = Nothing
    Set wsCombined = Nothing
End Sub
